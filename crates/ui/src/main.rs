#![cfg_attr(not(debug_assertions), windows_subsystem = "windows")]
//! globaltokentracker-ui — WinUI 3 shell via windows-reactor.
//! Dumb renderer over core ViewModels; theme + layout are data (`ui.json`
//! next to ledger.db), so skins / widget ordering survive without recompiles.
//!
//! Release builds are GUI-subsystem — no stray console window. Diagnostics
//! (`diag!`, panic stderr) only exist when GTT_DEBUG=1; then we attach to the
//! parent console, or allocate one for a double-clicked debug launch.
