## Overview

GlobalTokenTracker unifies local usage stats from AI coding tools: token counts, estimated USD cost from a live price book, subscription quota/credit balances, latency and model distribution. It incrementally scans on-disk logs **read-only** into a local SQLite ledger — nothing is uploaded.

The UI is native WinUI 3 (Rust + windows-reactor), built for small binary size, fast cold start and stable tray-resident operation. The statistics engine is decoupled from the UI and designed with future macOS portability in mind.

## Features

- Five views: Overview / Detail / Quota / Sources / Prices, with persistent tool+model filtering
- Exact bucketing: non-cached input / cache-read / cache-write / output tokens
- **Cross-checked price book**: nine public sources (models.dev, LiteLLM, llmpricing.dev, OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway, Helicone, Langfuse, llm-prices.com, Portkey) synced every 12 h; a model is billed at the price **most sources agree on**, so one feed's mistake never reaches the ledger. Offline seed fallback
- Prices page: **search by model** (case- and separator-insensitive: `opus 4.6`, `gpt mini`), a "n/m sources agree" pill per row, per-source quotes on hover, and a "disputed only" filter
- USD estimates kept strictly separate from subscription credits/percentages
- Incremental byte-cursor scanning; truncation/rotation handled; read-only on all sources
- Ledger snapshot backup (two generations) with open-time self-healing
- Periodic or file-watch-only refresh modes; tray-resident
- In-place upgrades: the installer remembers custom dirs and stops running processes
- OTLP/HTTP receiver on `127.0.0.1:4318` for tools that emit telemetry

## Supported sources

| Tool | Form | Level |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Local JSONL logs | ✅ exact + quota (when credentialed) |
| Codex | Local sessions | ✅ exact + quota |
| Devin | OTLP receiver | ✅ exact |
| OpenCode / ZCode / Grok / WorkBuddy / MiniMax Code / Kimi Code | Local logs | ✅ exact |
| Cline | `ui_messages.json` + editor globalStorage | ✅ exact (self-reported cost) |
| Command Code | Local JSONL | ✅ exact (self-reported cost) |
| Antigravity (app / IDE / `agy` CLI) | Local conversation databases `~/.gemini/antigravity*/…/*.db` | ✅ exact (incl. thinking tokens; no cache-write data) |
| CodeBuddy IDE | `state.vscdb` / sessions | 🟡 session-level + model multipliers |
| Cursor / Qoder | Credentials + official quota APIs | 🟡 quota-oriented |

Uninstalled tools are skipped and marked on the Sources page. Deleting a tool's local data does not lose already-ledgered stats.

## Requirements

Windows 10 **1809+** x64 · Windows App Runtime 1.5+ (auto-installed by the setup on first run; may trigger UAC once) · no admin rights needed · ~20 MB disk.

## Install & update

Grab `GlobalTokenTracker-Setup-<ver>-win-x64.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/jichuo1/GlobalTokenTracker/releases). Double-click for the GUI, or `--quiet` / `--dir <path>` / `--uninstall` for console control. To upgrade, just run the newer installer — it reuses your install location (custom dirs included), stops running processes and preserves all user data under `%USERPROFILE%\.globaltokentracker`.

> [!WARNING]
> The package is currently unsigned — SmartScreen will warn ("More info → Run anyway"). Verify the SHA-256 on the Release page.

## Build

```powershell
cargo build --release --workspace   # Rust 1.90+, edition 2024 + Windows SDK
cargo test --workspace
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File installer\package.ps1   # single-file setup → dist\
```

## Privacy

Price sync only issues **GET** requests to the nine public sources above — no usage data, paths or account details are sent (offline seed covers failure). The update check (GitHub Releases) and the optional vendor quota queries are the only other traffic; nothing from your logs is uploaded. The OTLP receiver binds loopback only. Source logs are never modified. User data lives in `%USERPROFILE%\.globaltokentracker` and survives updates and uninstalls.
